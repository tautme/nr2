It looks as though I have been doing something wrong with all the other attempts. This time I created a local file and found that I didn't have to make a directory because git init <filename> creates one for you. Then I just created a new repo with the same name on github and followed the instructions git remote add origin <url>. then git push -u origin master. I will now go back and try with a cloned version
